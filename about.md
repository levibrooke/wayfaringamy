Why is it I can so willingly plunge 10,000 feet from an airplane as I yell and laugh in the face of death but I am petrified when it comes to making other life decisions?

Do I trust that the stranger strapped to my back would save both his and my life more than I trust myself to make the best life decisions for my life and happiness? Am I less scared of actually dying than the possibility of failing at something and having to restart part(s) of my life? Am I the only one who thinks like that? What does that say about me that I am less afraid of death than I am of failing? Or worse, the peer criticism that follows failure?

Partially because I claim to be an adrenaline junkie and partially because I think I am just that ... Naive, stupid, reckless ... I am jumping out of another perfectly good airplane. This time only figuratively. 

As of September 2015, I left the job that was no longer the right fit for me. 

I gave up my salary - which by no means was substantial, but I earned enough to pay bills, have fun, and save money - along with my secured benefits such as insurance, 401K matching program, free lunches, sick pay and guaranteed two weeks of vacation each year. I willingly gave up what so many people strive to achieve for their whole life. 

Why? Because I wasn't happy. 

Cue the criticism from the many Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, and Generation X people who influenced my upbringing. From the generations who worked in 9-5 or dawn-to-dusk jobs until they retired. From the generations who paved the way for their children to have a better, fluffier upbringing than their own. 

But, please, spare me the lecture. 

After I graduated from high school (with a 3.8 GPA and a scholarship to college), I went to university and took honors courses, studied abroad twice, participated in extracurricular activities, built my resume and my network, was nominated for and won awards. I had an internship and started working - within my degree - the Monday after I walked across stage to accept my university diploma. I've held jobs and moved up, been given raises, and worked long hours to start my career. I have done everything that our society expects from me. I am self-sufficient and have even rescued my own pets. So, I apologize for the fact that a monotonous 9-5 job just is not the right fit for me.

This is supposed to be The Land of the Free, but every day someone else does something that - sorry, Mom - pisses off some other group within our society. I am tired of hearing, "I wish I would have done that when I was younger" from people in the same generations who criticize me for quitting my job. The mixed reactions from many in the same crowds gives me whiplash.

We have people who are working towards creating robots; and guess what? That probably makes a majority of them happy. The rest of us don't need to do their jobs for them and turn ourselves into robots. Nor should we have to apologize if a certain lifestyle isn't for us. 

I did not leave my job last year to sit around and live off food stamps and unemployment checks when I can physically work. I have spent my time doing freelance and contract writing; working as a florist and as a server. I have worked to earn my pay, and I am paying my taxes. I have busted my butt in creative, people-driven fields because that makes me happier than working 9-5 and we don't need to grow the percentage of adults with depression or other mental health issues in our society. 

And, after the last year, I am taking the opportunity to move home to be closer to family, as well as the opportunity to travel as much as I can. Some believe me moving to my hometown or traveling long-term means I am running away. That’s not the case. I have nothing to run away from. This life excites me and makes me happy. I appreciate those who will support my endeavors, and the concern from my critics. I am walking forward, steadfast and with open arms to a new future.

I refuse to lead a particular life just because that is what someone or a group of people expect of me. I refuse to lead a life where I am less terrified of death than failure. I should not be scared by either. 

And - again, sorry Mom - if I fall on my ass - which I have already done multiple times in the last year - I'll pick myself up any way that I can, brush myself off, and move forward. So, while I have my youth, I will do those things that others wish they had when they were my age. I am going to take those risks. When I have grey hair and grandkids, I am going to tell them, "I did those things. You don't have to wait until you have wrinkles. Do what makes you happy."

Who knows? Maybe my grandkids will be happy with a 9 - 5 job, and they'll call me crazy, too.
